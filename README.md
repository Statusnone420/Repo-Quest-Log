# Repo Quest Log

A local-first CLI + TUI + desktop + VS Code shell that makes repo intent legible at a glance — and hands that intent to whichever coding agent you open next.

It reads your planning markdown (`PLAN.md`, `STATE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) and builds a live structured HUD of what's happening now, what's next, and what's blocked. No server, no LLM calls, no account.

## Install

### Desktop app (Windows)
Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Statusnone420/Repo-Quest-Log/releases):
- **`Repo Quest Log Setup <version>.exe`** — recommended, installs like any app
- **`Repo Quest Log <version>.exe`** — portable, run anywhere

> First launch may trigger Windows SmartScreen. That's expected for a new binary with low reputation — check the publisher name and file name before allowing.

### VS Code extension
```bash
code --install-extension repo-quest-log-0.0.4.vsix
```
Download the `.vsix` from the same release page, then run the command above.

### CLI (from source)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Statusnone420/Repo-Quest-Log.git
cd Repo-Quest-Log
npm install
npm run build
npm link   # makes `repolog` available globally
```

## Prompt Templates

Built-in presets are always available. Override per-user or per-repo:

- **User:** `~/.repolog/prompts/*.md`
- **Repo:** `.repolog/prompts/*.md` (wins over user)

Frontmatter fields: `id`, `label`, `sub`, `glyph`, `keywords`

Available template variables:
```
{{name}}  {{branch}}  {{mission}}  {{objective.title}}
{{objective.done}}  {{objective.total}}  {{resume.task}}
{{now}}  {{next}}  {{blocked}}  {{agents}}
```

## Repo Setup

RepoLog reads standard markdown files it finds in the repo root. No config required to get started.

| File | What it feeds |
|---|---|
| `PLAN.md` | Objective, Now / Next / Blocked task lists |
| `STATE.md` | Current focus, resume note, recent decisions |
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` | Agent roles, owned areas, activity feed |
| `.repolog.json` | Optional: `writeback`, `prompts.dir`, `excludes` |
| `.repolog/CHARTER.md` | Agent onboarding doc (generate with `repolog tuneup --write-charter`) |

Heading patterns that the scanner recognises: `## Objective`, `## Now`, `## Next`, `## Blocked`, `## Mission`, `## Owned Areas`, `## Resume Note`. See [`docs/SCHEMA.md`](docs/SCHEMA.md) for the full spec.

## "Tune this repo" — Score and Fix

```bash
repolog tuneup
```

Scores your repo's markdown legibility from 0–100 across 8 checks (mission, objective, now-heading, agent owned areas, state resume note, plan next section, charter present, frontmatter). Outputs a targeted fix prompt you can paste directly into Claude, Codex, or Gemini.

```bash
repolog tuneup --write-charter   # generates .repolog/CHARTER.md
repolog tuneup --agent=claude    # Claude-specific prompt
```

The score also appears in the desktop Settings panel with a live coverage meter and one-click copy.

## Desktop: Open Any Repo

Press **Ctrl+O** (or File → Open Repo…) to point the app at any folder. The choice persists between sessions. You can also create a desktop shortcut to `Repo Quest Log.exe` and drag a folder onto it to open that repo directly.
